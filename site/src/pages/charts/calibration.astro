        Up until this point we've used the midpoint of each market as the
        refrence value. What if we used something else, such as the average
        probability or a fixed point in time?

      <div class="my-2">
        Typically all markets are trated equally with a raw average. What if we
        used a weighted average instead? For instance, markets with $100 in
        trade volume might be weighted 10 times as heavily as one with $10.
