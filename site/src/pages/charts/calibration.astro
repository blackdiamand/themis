        Typically all markets are trated equally with a raw average. What if we
        used a weighted average instead? For instance, markets with $100 in
        trade volume might be weighted 10 times as heavily as one with $10. This
        allows us to prioritize markets that have properties we think are
        beneficial without ignoring others.
