        Numbers are great, but context is better. We do our best to describe our
        results, but no textual description will convey as much information as a
        chart or visualization of some kind. Our goal is to let you see the
        numerical context and draw your own conclusions. Check out the charts
        below for all platforms, or select a platform to filter to just those
        markets.

      Are you looking for charts from the old Calibration City site? We're
      working on bringing all of those features over here, but in the meantime
      you can access it at <a

        class="text-lavender underline"
        target="_blank">https://old.calibration.city</a

      out of date.
