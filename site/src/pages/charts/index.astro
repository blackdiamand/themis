        Numbers are great, but context is better. We do our best to describe our
        results, but no textual description will convey as much information as a
        chart or visualization of some kind. With a chart you can see numerical
        context and even draw your own conclusions.

      Are you looking for charts from the old Calibration City site? I'm working
      on bringing all of those features over here, but in the meantime you can
      access it at <a
        href="https://old.calibration.city"
        class="text-lavender underline"
        target="_blank">https://old.calibration.city</a
      >. Note that it doesn't get data updates as frequently, so it may be a bit
      out of date.
