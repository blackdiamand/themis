      <a href="https://predictionmetrics.org/" target="_blank"
        >PredictionMetrics.org</a
      > launched in 2025 to help people compare and evaluate prediction markets fairly.
      Our mission is to help the public make informed decisions about which markets
      to trust and how to interpret forecasting data. We believe in transparency,
      honest comparisons, and providing meaningful context.
    </p>
    <p class="my-2">
      The idea for this site started in July 2023 when we set out to create a
      calibration plot for Manifold, as they weren't publishing their own
      accuracy statistics at the time. What began as "Calibration City"
      eventually grew to include other platforms like Kalshi, Metaculus, and
      Polymarket. Thanks to grants from the Manifold Community Fund and EA
      Community Choice programs, we were able to expand our work. We added more
      markets, created new filters and charts, tracked accuracy metrics, and
      built guides for newcomers. However, we weren't comfortable sharing hard
      numerical accuracy scores or directly comparing platforms because they
      were fundamentally different from each other.
    </p>
    <p class="my-2">
      While our data was solid, it wasn't conveying the insights people
      expected. Calibration is very useful, but it can't ever tell the whole
      story. In January 2025, we initiated a complete overhaul. We started
      fresh, linking similar markets across platforms and finding directly
      comparable questions. We built a new website, less focused on
      experimentation and more focused on showing valuable results. We wanted to
      have something that actually answered questions like “How accurate are
      prediction markets?” and “Which platform is more accurate on the topics I
      care about?”
    </p>
    <p class="my-2">
      We're still growing - adding new platforms, curating interesting
      questions, and building new features. You can find all our source code

        <p class="my-2">
          Broadly, we support all binary and multiple-choice markets on all
          supported platforms. There are a few asterisks around this, however.
        </p>
        <p class="my-2">
          For platforms like Kalshi and Polymarket where all markets are binary,
          the process is straightforward. Simple yes/no questions are extracted
          as-is, with the probability based on the price of the YES side. On
          these platforms, question groups are actually constructed out of
          binary markets (usually in the form of "Will team X win game Y?" or
          "Will metric X be greater than Y at time Z?") which makes extraction
          straightforward.
        </p>
        <p class="my-2">
          Manifold and Metaculus have a number of different market types, which
          they use for question groups and continuous spreads.
        </p>
        <ul class="my-2 ml-5 list-disc">
          <li>
            For dependent multiple-choice markets, where there are many
            potential outcomes but only one outcome can be selected (e.g. "Which
            film will win best picture at the 2025 Oscars?"). For those markets,
            we track the winner and use that option's probability over time as
            the market probability.
          </li>
          <li>
            On Manifold, dependent multiple-choice markets can actually resolve
            to multiple options as long as their resolution values sum to one.
            We do not currently evaluate markets that resolve in this way.
          </li>
          <li>
            For independent multiple choice markets, where any number of options
            can be selected, we decompose all options into their own binary
            markets. Each option has its own probability history and statistics.
            Currently only Manifold has this type, everyone else implements this
            concept as groups of binary markets.
          </li>
          <li>
            Both Manifold and Metaculus have a few versions of continuous
            markets, which predict a numeric value or date. For Manifold this
            includes "PseudoNumeric", "Number", "MultiNumeric", and "Date". For
            Metaculus this includes "Numeric" and "Date". We do not currently
            evaluate these markets, but we have plans to do so in the future.
          </li>
          <li>
            Finally, Metaculus has the special "Conditional" type. They are not
            currently supported but we have plans to implement this type in the
            future.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p class="my-2">
          We do not evaluate non-market items from any platform, such as
          bounties, posts, or non-forecasting polls. Our downloader runs
          nightly, and notifies us of any new or unrecognized market types so we
          can implement them as quickly as possible.

          How do you match markets together?

        </h3>
        <p class="my-2">
          When we first started working on the Calibration City site, we
          realized how different each prediction market platform was. The
          apples-to-oranges problem has reared its head many times and we were
          certainly not the first to realize this.
        </p>
        <p class="my-2">
          Our goal with the matching process is to find equivalent markets
          across platforms, usually by targeting one of the following
          situations.
        </p>
        <ul class="my-2 ml-5 list-disc">
          <li>
            There are some events that most prediction markets are already
            tracking, such as elections or sports tournaments. These are usually
            high-volume, popular markets, but can have subtle differences in
            resolution criteria.
          </li>
          <li>
            Some platforms will create "mirrors" of existing markets from other
            platforms, allowing users to see differences and arbitrate. These
            are nice because they will always resolve the same, but are usually
            limited to platforms that allow users to make their own markets.
          </li>
          <li>
            Occasionally, external groups will make predictions or encourage
            others to predict specific questions. Some of these, such as the ACX
            prediction content, have a wide range of valuable questions that
            share resolution criteria. Even better, some of these have awards
            that encourage good turnout.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p class="my-2">
          After downloading items from each platform's API, we use a couple
          techniques to try to find these markets. We generate <a
            href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Word_embedding">embeddings</a
          > to find similar markets, then refine matches using tags, keywords, duration
          overlap, and other heuristics.
        </p>
        <p class="my-2">
          The final decision as to whether two markets are "equivalent" can be
          surprisingly difficult. For instance, there can be two markets that
          resolve on December 31st vs January 1st, or use two different news
          sources, or have any other number of slight variations that make them
          not 100% equivalent. In order to stay in the spirit of the concept, we
          allow grouping markets as long as these differences wouldn't have more
          than a 1% chance of changing the resolution.
        </p>
        <p class="my-2">
          All matches are picked and approved by real people. We do our best,
          but there may be some mistakes. <a href="#contact">Contact us</a> if you

        <h4 class="text-lg italic">Absolute Scores</h4>
        <p class="my-2">
          All absolute scores are calculated based on a criterion probability
          and scored using a scoring rule. The criterion probability is what we
          reference as the market's "prediction", and can be at a specific point
          in time like the midpoint or 30 days before resolution, or it could be
          an aggregation such as the time-weighted average probability.

          The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brier_score">Brier score</a

        <h4 class="text-lg italic">Relative Scores</h4>
        <p class="my-2">
          Relative scores are calculated based on the performance of the market
          relative to other markets. They provide a measure of how well the
          market has performed compared to its peers. These are only present for
          markets that are linked in a question, since they are scored against
          the other markets in that question.
        </p>
        <p class="my-2">
          We calculate a relative score with each scoring rule, which you can
          find on the individual question pages. The overall process is the
          exact same between each, with the only difference being the scoring
          rule used. Scoring rules where a lower score is better will be
          evaluated the same way for a relative score, so a lower relative Brier
          score is better while a higher relative logarithmic score is better.
        </p>
        <p class="my-2">
          The process to calculate relative scores for a group of markets starts
          by determining the scoring period. We choose to score groups for the
          duration where at least two markets are open. In some situations, we
          also override the start or end dates so that the scoring period does
          not include days where the outcome was already known.
        </p>
        <p class="my-2">
          For each day in the scoring period, we calculate each market's score
          using a scoring rule (Brier, log, etc.) and, from those, calculate the
          median score. We then subtract the median from each market's daily
          score and save it as the daily relative score.
        </p>
        <p class="my-2">
          Finally, we sum all of the daily relative scores for each market and
          divide that by the total number of days in the scoring period. Note
          that this is not a simple average! For markets that were not open for
          the entire scoring period, their sum is being divided by more days
          than they had values for. This means that a market that otherwise
          performed the same as another but was open for less time will have a
          relative score closer to zero. Also note that relative scores can be
          both positive and negative, since this is the difference from a median
          score.
        </p>
        <p class="my-2">
          One way to represent this score for each market would be:
        </p>
        <div class="text-center my-4">
          <Math
            equation={String.raw`\displaystyle\text{Relative Score} = \frac{\sum_{i=1}^{n} (s_i - m_i)}{n}`}
          />
        </div>
        <p class="my-2">
          Where <Math equation="s_i" /> is the market's score on day <Math
            equation="i"
          />, <Math equation="m_i" /> is the median score on day <Math
            equation="i"
          />, and <Math equation="n" /> is the number of days we're scoring.

          The letter grades are intended to be an easy-to-read, intuitive
          representation of how well the market has performed on a specific
          axis. Each score (e.g. Brier score at market midpoint, spherical score
          one month before close, etc.) has a corresponding letter grade, which
          is determined by comparing the score to a set of predefined
          thresholds.
        </p>
        <p class="my-2">The thresholds for absolute scores are:</p>
        <table class="table-fixed w-full">

            <tr>
              <th>Grade</th>
              {scoreTypes.map((st) => <th>{st.name}</th>)}

          <tbody>
            {
              gradeCutoffs.map((g) => (

                  {g.scores.map((score) => (
                    <td class="font-mono">
                      {score.min.toFixed(4)} to {score.max.toFixed(4)}
                    </td>

        <p class="my-2">
          The thresholds for relative scores are a little different. The
          relative scoring algorithm we use results in a lot of scores very
          close to zero with a sharp dropoff and roughly-symmetrical curve on
          either side. We calculate our grade cutoffs so that C+ is centered at
          zero, with widths based on the deviations of the scores.
